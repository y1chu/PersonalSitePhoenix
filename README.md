# Ingrid Chu's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. As a tech enthusiast with a passion for Final Fantasy's rich lore and themes, my website captures the essence of rebirth and transformation, much like the phoenixâ€”a symbol closely tied to my identity and journey.

## Purpose of the Site

This website is more than just a digital resume. It paints a picture of my evolution in the tech world. The phoenix, intricately linked to my Chinese heritage through my last name, epitomizes rebirth, resilience, and the infinite cycle of life. Embracing the spirit of the phoenix, I am committed to adapting, learning from every experience, and consistently bettering myself.

## Design Aesthetics

- **Phoenix-Centric**: Every design choice, from colors to animations, embodies the fiery and majestic nature of a phoenix.
- **Final Fantasy Motifs**: A testament to my admiration for Final Fantasy, the website subtly incorporates elements and inspirations from the game.
- **Vivid Particle Effects**: Adding a touch of liveliness, the particle effects encapsulate the blazing spirit of the phoenix and provide the site with a unique visual appeal.

## Continuous Evolution

True to the nature of a phoenix and the tech industry, this website is perpetually evolving. Regular updates introduce new styles, features, and content. Your feedback is invaluable in this transformative journey, so please share any suggestions or insights!
