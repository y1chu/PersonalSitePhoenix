# Ingrid Chu's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. As someone with a deep appreciation for Final Fantasy and its themes, I've always resonated with the idea of rebirth and transformation. This theme is reflected in both the design and purpose of this site. 

## Why This Site Exists

This website is not just a showcase of my professional experiences and projects; it's a representation of my journey and growth in the tech industry. The phoenix, which is also the first character of my Chinese last name, symbolizes rebirth, renewal, and the endless cycle of life. Much like a phoenix, I believe in rising from the ashes, learning from past experiences, and continuously evolving.

## Theme and Design

- **Phoenix-Themed**: The design elements, colors, and animations have been chosen to represent the fiery essence of a phoenix.
- **Final Fantasy Inspiration**: As an avid fan of Final Fantasy, subtle nods and inspirations can be found throughout the site.
- **Dynamic Particle Effects**: These effects give the site a vibrant and unique look, representing the fiery spirit of the phoenix.

## Work in Progress

This project is a living entity, much like the phoenix itself. It is continually evolving as new features, styles, and content are added. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
